# Accessible Design

Accessible Design is a project that highlight my learning and practice of the Web Accessibility feature. The feature makes sure teh website is inclusive to all and accessible. The website feature the use of ARIA, skip navigation link, semantic HTML, `alt` tag, javascript validating the email and updating the DOM element that uses `aria-live` to notify the user of the update, and using CSS rules like background-blend-mode to blend the background-image that has text floating on it.

##Reflection Questions

1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
